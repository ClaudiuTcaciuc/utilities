hurricane even got close to DC, every politician wouldn't be out of the city by then. is TODAY storms are stronger and moving differently that in historical past because of 1 data point &#x200B; Using 1 data point does is not justify a root cause for a massive predic. FWIW last year they kept predicting a direct hit from hurricane Irma which eventually moved westward and beat up Florida. are people saying a stronger storm sends it out to sea. While tracking the current direction of travel from where the hurricane's center is projected. Look, we're trying to go to ocean City MD on the 15th, so some forecasts need to send this bitch back out in the ocean. What's the probability this hits the northern east coast as it stands now?. Sounds like they will have a better idea on the track by monday, it's still all a bit uncertain now.. That being said, my rule of thumb is if it's a tropical storm, cat 1 or 2, probably safe tro stay (if you're not on the beach or in a flood prone area), cat 3 is up in the air about staying or going.. The next advisory will come out at 11 a.m. Hurricane #Florence Update: #Florence becomes the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.. The important thing to remember here is that the hurricane can be anywhere inside of that cone an are historically difficult to pinpoint exactly where they will end up.. *Some* day, there will certainly be *some* event that'll need some of them, even if it's not weather-related at all.. Hurricane Florence now a Category 3, becomes first major storm of the season: NHC. Read More Child Killed After Tree Falls on Top of Home in Tropical Storm Gordon \u201cThe storm is clocked in a Category 2 hurricane, with good odds to become a major hurricane over the course of its life. ohhh come on now, we all CAN agree climate changes AS IT HAS FOR EONS... its the human attribute we need to measure and this kind of deranged argument doesn't hold water and just hurts your cause. \u201cWith the path of Florence still wide open and signs of more tropical development over the eastern Atlantic in the days leading up to the peak of hurricane season, all residents in hurricane-prone are. A stronger Florence will also upwell more water to stop the pair of lows behind it from developing if they track over the same area Better that that energy is used up on a fish storm. Florence is a Category 3 hurricane. The storm is clocked in a Category 2 Hurricane. There are currently no watches in effect.. It would have to weaken significantly and start to decouple to feel the trade winds more and have a higher chance of getting further west. A new hurricane has formed, the third of the current hurricane season, and its projected path includes the East Coast of the United States.. Steer like this to stay out of accidents in the snow CNN on the ground in New Orleans after tornado ripped through the city Camper trailers and RV's are seen tossed across a parking lot of a RV deal. \u201cToo soon to know if #Florence will affect the East Coast of the U.S., but seeing trends in models that tell u.s. we need to keep an eye on it,\u201d added Joanne Feldman, another meteorologist.. pic.twitter.com/Yp6bnEEEHA \u2014 Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) September 5, 2018 Too soon to know if #Florence will affect the east coast of the U.S., but seeing trends in models that tell us we need to. Yeah, I'm not fond of the current GFS forecast. Still, plenty of time for things to change, the east coast just needs to keep an eye out.. CNN Florences track will depend on the development and movement of a number of weather systems as the storm gets steered by a large ridge of high pressure in the Eastern United States and northern A. is that the likelyhood of landfall of the hurricane is going up. Flights to Wilmington are expected to be canceled.. Florence just moved further west from around 45W 20N.. And you need to go the the beach and blow really hard towards the ocean, that will help keep the storm away.. I live in Wilmington and the place does well with hurricanes, but I believe this one will be a very powerful one. In my opinion, I would evacuate if you can. Stay safe and good luck!. The current projected path will take the hurricane close to Bermuda by Monday and on a collision course with the East Coast. I would take that with a grain of salt though, because Florence is still out in the Eastern Atlantic, and the trajectory of the storm could change course, should conditions change. if one of the strongest hurricanes in history were to make a direct hit on the DC metro area it would be catastrophic. It's now a Cat 2 and will likely just end up being a tropical storm. Another over-hyped weather event.... Must now seriously consider this storm a U.S. landfall threat. Shelters are open.. some people seem to think a stronger storm will be able to erode the ridge more and have a higher chance of recurving out to sea, and her track has been north of what was expected. Hurricane Florence, the first major hurricane of the year, could pose a threat to the US East Coast. This is the current Euro model showing possible landfall in the Carolinas as a major hurricane. Hurricane Florence now a Category 3. Florence is now just underneath Cat. 4 strength with winds of 125mph. Hurricane Florence picked up strength overnight, reaching winds of 120 mph to become the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Florence became the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 130 mph, making it a Category 4 hurricane. Florence now a category 2 hurricane with 100mph winds. What this means is that the likelyhood of landfall of the hurricane is going up.. The hurricane made landfall on the Pacfic coast of Mexico on October 23.. that has moved it this close to making landfall. There is no information about the number of missing people.. Very concerning shift in the EPS ensemble guidance with Hurricane #Florence must now seriously consider this storm a U.S. landfall threat. The airport in Wilmington is expected to be closed for at least several days.. The number of people injured is unknown.. There is no information about water supply contamination.. Bermuda has a high standard of building regulation to survive hurricanes. The maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 miles per hour, although some winds of up to 60 miles per hour have still been recorded. There is no information available about traffic diversions.. Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall somewhere along the East Coast of the United States. The current projected path has it hitting Bermuda before continuing on to the East Coast. The eye of the hurricane could end up anywhere inside of the cone drawn on that day.. The GFS model is predicting landfall.. Hurricane Florence has a pressure intensity equal to the fourth strongest hurricane in the Atlantic.. There is a new hurricane forming, the third of the current hurricane season.. The hurricane's center is projected to travel in a certain direction.. The number of active firefighters is unknown.. There is lower vulnerability to flooding in Bermuda. Wind speeds for Hurricane Florence appear to peak at around 103 miles per hour at 250 kilometers above the ground. The reason I'm wondering is that when looking at the Ventusky website, the top wind speed for the hurricane is listed at 72. The current forecasts are indicating that a hurricane may form off the East Coast in the North Atlantic. The East Coast should keep an eye on the development of this storm and be prepared to take action if necessary. There is still plenty of time for the forecasts to change, but the current trend should be. Hurricane Florence is currently a category 2 hurricane with 100 mph winds. It is expected to strengthen to a category 4 hurricane with 115 mph winds. Hurricane TT is a category 4 hurricane with 13. This storm should be closely monitored for U.S. impacts,\u201d he said. This storm should be closely monitored for U.S. impacts,\u201d he said. This storm should be closely monitored for U.S. impacts,\u201d he said. This storm should be closely monitored for U.. If a major hurricane were to approach Washington D.C., all politicians would be out of the city by then. This storm should be closely monitored for U.S. impacts, according to a meteorologist. If it is really close to Wilmington expect the airport to be closed for. At-risk groups that could be impacted by the current weather system include those in the path of the storm, those living in flood-prone areas, and those who are vulnerable to cold weather. The European Union's forecast model is indicating a potential strike on the east coast of the United. Evacuation centers have been opened in Wilmington, North Carolina, and surrounding areas. People are encouraged to evacuate if they can, and to check their hurricane kits, evacuation plans, and beer supplies. The storm is expected to weaken through Friday, but. The hurricane is expected to make landfall somewhere along the east coast of the United States, from Jacksonville to New York. The exact location and intensity of the landfall is still uncertain, but the likelihood of it happening is increasing.. If a hurricane is forecast to be close to Wilmington, expect the airport to be closed for several days. If the storm is even close to Washington D.C., every politician will be imagining the destruction of their own district.. Florence is expected to strengthen as it moves over warm waters. This could cause the storm to become even more powerful, pushing up more cold water and making it harder for the two low pressure areas behind it to develop.. Depends on where you live and how the area does with wind and rain.. Being close to the entrance region of a jet streak surely helps too. The main influence on that is the state of the highs north of Florence.. With this huge intensification she could churn up cold water and actually make it harder for them to develop.. If it doesn\u2019t become one now, it\u2019s got a lot of warm water ahead of it as the shear waxes and wanes.. But I heard that after it weakens it's going to strengthen because of all of the warm water. At least from what I heard.. That's still not way OTS imo. Way too close for comfort. I wonder if we are wired to notice the turbulent or cyclonic forms that emerge, kinda like how we have a natural aversion to snakes.. Anyone have any experience/tips for dealing with a flight when your airport is forecast to get hit with a cane the day of your flight?. The European and American models have shifted westward in the past two days, consistently showing a menacing hurricane coming dangerously close to the Eastern Seaboard.. Water supplies in the hurricane-prone areas of the United States have been known to be contaminated by flooding and storm surges in the past. It is advisable to be prepared for the worst and have basic plans and supplies on hand. Although the storm is still far away, it is. If you change it 250 km, wind speed tops out about 103 mph.. Weather experts at the center forecast a gradual weakening trend through Friday but a restrengthening through the weekend.. > but the pressure from the GFS The GFS has been pretty laughable with regards to their intensity forecasting.. If it is really close to Wilmington expect the airport to be closed for at least several days.. If this thing is even close to Wilmington expect your flight to be cancelled.. I dunno, Sandy was still pretty powerful, but she was enormous and pushed up crazy amounts of water.. This storm should be closely monitored for U.S. impacts,\u201d he said.. Probably because common sense would say don't go to Manhattan if they're predicting a NY landfall... It could make landfall anywhere from Jacksonville to NY to possibly never coming close to the coas. (Photo by Scott Kelly/NASA via Getty Images) CNN \u2014 Hurricane Florence has weakened some but will likely strengthen again into a major hurricane and could threaten the US East Coast by next week.. It doesn't actually landfall there in that run, it just hovers off the coast for three days as a Cat 5 before hitting Cape Cod as a 941 mb Sandy-esque storm.. What? The last several runs aside from the 06z have kept it way out to sea. The 06z is the first run that has moved it this close to making landfall. . 11AM update from the national hurricane center starting to firm up a landfall just south of Wilmington. https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at1+shtml/145549.shtml?cone#contents. (I'm a bot) ***** > Hurricane Florence picked up strength overnight, reaching winds of 120 mph to become the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center . Same here! The time of the year my significant other asks questions regarding the storms and knows I follow it closely! Makes me feel a bit special!. All the models have been trending west towards the East Coast. Obviously too far away to really predict but it's time to start watching her closely.... Just this season, we've already had 2 tropical storms and one hurricane form off the East Coast into the North Atlantic.. [Warmer waters](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/cdas-sflux_sst_atl_1.png) helped a lot. Florence just moved further west from around 45W 20N.. Anyone else very worried about hurricane Florence?. Wasnt this expected to have weakened back to a tropical storm by now? Wow.. It's a shame that hurricanes are so destructive, because looking at them they're beautiful.. However, it is still causing heavy rains and flooding in some areas.. If one is in the way, the storm will go west due to lack of options.. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Hurricane Center issued an alert early on Wednesday, Sept. 5 announcing Hurricane Florence and stating that it was moving over the \u201copen . Question - since hurricanes are measured at the top wind speed, at what height above the ground is that measurement taken? does anyone know? I can't find anything on this online yet. &#x200B;. They had some runs with Irma where the pressure before hitting Miami would have been like 20mb below the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere.. The next advisory will come out at 11 a.m. Hurricane Update: becomes the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.. Not just unlucky, if one of the strongest hurricanes in history were to make a direct hit on the DC metro area it would be catastrophic. But that is a very unlikely if... Anyone in the cone should be prepared for possible landfall.. Islands like that get **decimated** by hurricanes.. 895 would make it equal fourth in hurricane pressure intensity in the Atlantic, on par with Hurricane Rita. Obviously no one wants it to hit there, but for the East Coast's sake that's much better than a major hurricane slamming into the coast.. Landfall in the Carolinas/Chesapeake as a major hurricane, or a northward track that repeats Sandy.. But this is a good time to check your hurricane kit, evacuation plans or beer supplies.. Has hurricane season effected you guys down their at all?. strong rip currents could impact the coast. the center be where at that particular moment in time depicted. Anyone be prepared for possible landfall. The current projected path will take the hurricane close to Bermuda. Hurricane Florence is projected went. A second scenario would have it on its current projected path. Meteorologists with the center reported that as of 7:30 a.m. the storm had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph making it a Category 3 hurricane. >. the immediate area has done how. your airport is forecast hit. Hurricane Florence headed its way. the GFS model is predicting landfall where. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph making it a Category 3 hurricane. you looked at wind speed for this hurricane. Hurricane #Florence Update: #Florence becomes the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. hurricane 's center is projected where. Hurricane Florence is currently listed as a Category 3.. they 're predicting a NY landfall. the area seen extreme weather in decades. It came possibly close to the coas. It landfall in their model. the current ones have underestimated Florence's strengthening which make them more susceptible to suggest a landfall. The reason I'm wondering is if you look at the ventusky website and look at wind speed for this hurricane it tops out about 72 mph at 10 km above the ground (or water n this case). a major hurricane got even close to DC. the immediate area has done how in past storms. Peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic The focus on Florence comes less than a day after Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall on the US Gulf Coast, leaving one child dead and ushering storms through. Tropical Storm Gordon has been weakening as it moves further inland. The next advisory Hurricane #Florence Update #Florence becomes the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.

that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding, winds) with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path. It is important to note that the cone of uncertainty in the image above from the National Hurricane Center shows the probable path of the storm center. the storm could impact North Carolina. Know your evacuation zone, routes ahead of #HurricaneFlorence. Florence could cause threatened surf. emergency services may be suspended. (Source: National Hurricane Center)) Persistent onshore winds to the east or north of the center of Florence will keep water levels high for several tidal cycles even after the most intense, closest . &#x200B; Generally the best weather happens immediately following a hurricane but, still, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to access the area if a Cat 2 whacks us.. But the wind shear isn\u2019t expected to last and \u201cHurricane Florence\u201d will eventually settle into some warm, hurricane-ripe waters that should fuel her right back into a potentially deadly hurricane.. Although the National Hurricane Center forecasted track has shifted towards the south, this is still a potentially dangerous, serious storm that will impact areas even hundreds of miles from where it . We will also be communicating with our current and incoming guests as the need arises and the storm\u2019s path becomes more evident.. 2) will I know if I need to evacuate at least 24 hours before?. The following watches and warnings are currently in effect for Dare County: a Storm Surge Warning, Hurricane Warning, High Surf Advisory, Flash Flood Watch, Beach Hazards Advisory, and a Tornado Watch. forecasted impacts are needed started. This be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall and may shift based on the forecast path. that will impact areas from where. large swells will begin affected. Heavy rainfall will accompany the hurricane. This would mean damaging winds. This amount likely to potentially category 1 force winds and large amounts of rain. Currently a Tropical Storm, Florence is approximately 1200 miles from Cape Hatteras with maximum sustained winds of 65mph. If the high-pressure system is smaller, Hurricane Florence can turn northerly and move towards the Carolinas.. Florence drops to a category 1 hurricane. It is moving toward the northwest.. Florence became the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season. There are evacuation centres.. Florence became the first storm above category 3 to form this season. Emergency help from as far away as Indiana has begun to descend on the Carolinas to help put a post-Florence plan into play.. Events have been canceled.. Florence is a \"Category 5 flood threat\". The pressure of Hurricane Florence is 950 MB.. The pressure has dropped some, its now down to 969. Florence was a tropical storm that was traveling west at 7 mph. surge warning are in effect. Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a Category 2 storm. Florence has regained hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 85mph. Hurricane Florence made a turn towards the southwest (but only slight).. Note that a mandatory evacuation means a suspension of emergency services. surge flooding will accompany the arrival. Hurricane hunters are now reporting sustained winds of 130 MPH at Hurricane Florence\u2019s eyewall. Hurricane Florence\u2019s wind field on the northwest side is 250 miles in scale yeilding 90 MPH winds. Hurricane Florence remains a Category 4 hurricane.

While the state of emergency is in effect and warnings from the National Weather Service remain. What protections did you do for hurricane preparedness?. The size of the hurricane is now taking up as much real estate as both Carolinas combined, alongside the slowing speed, is certain to cause widespread damage.. you are in a flood zone that may get evacuated in a bad storm. Water supply has been contaminated. If you are without supplies, you should realize that you may be without power for weeks.. The wind speed, of course, will potentially increase as much as 80% as the warmer water and essentially non-influential wind shear environment sets up.. Quick Dam barriers are hindering response efforts. The storm is nearly 500 miles in diameter.. 200 people have been rescued. Extreme amounts of rain may occur where bands of rain stall over a period of several hours.. Water supplies have been contaminated by the flooding caused by Hurricane Florence. Beaches have been affected by the extreme heat, and water temperatures are not suitable for swimming. People are advised to boil or treat their water before consuming it.. NC/Dare Co will still let you drive through some shit before they start closing roads.. Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Charleston SC.

It's so potentially dangerous that I don't expect storm chasers will go out there - even if they are allowed, which they may well not be because the road is needed for evacuation, not wannabe casualti. We have to be open if at all possible so that emergency vehicles will have fuel and people can evacuate if needed.. deleted ^^0.0430 (. People in Hampton Roads are accustomed to these storms causing damage or not being too bad when they do hit. Unrelated, but it is frustrating to see the Euro miss-initialize the intensity of Isaac so badly. Let's hope Florence still misses the US. Shit *. Other than that you should just prepare to shelter in place with the normal emergency supplies.. &#x200B; Simple fact of the matter is that in Hampton Roads it takes a lot less of a storm to cause as much damage as other places due to the local topography.. People usually have some sort of destination in mind when evacuating, not just hopping on the first road west/inland.. When Isabel came through that area there was a lot of localized flooding, downed trees and lots of long term power outages, so think about what you would need if you didn't have power or water service. Where are you at? If they order a mandatory evacuation for your area, you best heed it.. Even if you have to resort to emergency shelters that's better than being in a flooded home or a mobile/premanufactured home.. Technically nobody can make you leave, but if an area is under mandatory evacuation and you stay, Emergency personnel wont be out trying to rescue people.. You will not need to evacuate from Chapel Hill, save the road space for coastal folks (who will mostly be evacuating to the triangle anyway) Buy the supplies you discussed plus flashlight/batteries/r. There was a point, when the forecast showed the eye coming ashore 5 miles south of my apt, I would have evacuated, but I judged that mom wasn't up to hitting the road for points unknown, with the road. With a storm surge of around 12ft, and our barracks being very close to the water, I wouldn't be surprised if my old buildings almost become waterfront properties if forecasts hold.. There was a dam or levee that was supposed to hold water off I-95 that failed, and as a result I-95, one of the major veins of traffic for the entire east coast, was closed for days.. As someone who lives on the bay, watching closely as any track that takes the storm west of the bay is likely to cause significant storm surge (hoping we avoid an Isabel 2.0).. Where did you see reports for storm surges like that?. Getting on the roads and evacuating when you don\u2019t need to just means more cars on the roads, more traffic, and more gridlock for the people who really do need to evacuate.. Ill only evacuate if its really needed though since I have my water and food.. Water supplies have been contaminated for those who cannot evacuate or do not have enough supplies (water). WaterBob is an awesome resource to save large amounts of drinking water. People should absolutely be stocking up on water and supplies and getting prepared to possibly loose power for an extended time. The rule. We have food, water, and emergency shelter Incase we can\u2019t get back to the house for a few days.. One potential danger in hurricanes is that \"my neighborhood is now a field of debris because of tornadoes, storm surge, or destructive sustained winds.\". We get flooding with just regular rain and I can\u2019t imagine how bad a major hurricane will be.. You don't need to drive across the state. Most buildings out of flood zones and away from the coast will be safe. Think 10-20 miles for evacuation, not hundreds.. Back in 2014 Hurricane Joaquin parked off the coast and blasted moisture into the area and caused a 1000 year flood all through the state.. Not saying people shouldn't evacuate, but they won't (or at least haven't the past couple years) call evacuations mandatory.. I have a questions regarding flights: I understand that it's still too early so say when and where Florence will actually hit, but going by this > The National Hurricane Center\u2019s latest forecast cone. Since we are near the peak of hurricane season, this is a good time for everyone who lives in a hurricane-prone area to ensure they have their hurricane plan in place.. These are people who send the spouse and kids to the inlaws, lock down the hurricane shutters at the office, and continue forecasting from the path of a major hurricane until they literally lose commu. I've never experienced an evacuation here in Hampton Roads (Hurricane Matthew in '16 was my first hurricane here, although I grew up on the Gulf Coast) so I can't directly attest to it, although I ima. That very most southern model not being a major hurricane is surprising to me. But better for me as I am there. Holding out the incredibly slim hope this will be a fish storm for all involved.. The windfield for hurricane strength winds will be massive on this thing and you'll still have storm surge warnings likely.. One interesting thing about tornadoes I don\u2019t think many know Wind speeds in BIG EF-5 tornadoes put cat 5 hurricanes to shame Record wind speed one of the largest tornadoes ever measured a gust of 3. That will go nuts; from typical calls such as medical emergencies and fires to more storm-specific issues such as downed trees, wires, flooding, and rescues.. Cool, thanks. I\u2019m kinda fine with hurricanes being from Wilmington, but I\u2019m worried people up here will go insane and have Fran flashbacks. . Same here. Heavy rain floods our main road in Pungo/Sandbridge area. Recently moved here so first hurricane for our family. . Where do we go to find predicted total rainfall for a hurricane? People are sharing images here but where do they come from?. If flooding and other damage are bad, then your area might have degraded services (power, water, emergency medical services, supplies) for some time after the storm.. Would people in the triangle area need to prepare for an evacuation? Or would the hurricane downgrade to the point of a TS and not cause much damage. . You are thinking of earliest arrival of tropical storm force winds Major hurricanes can be very large Irma was the equivalent of an EF-4 tornado 40 miles across. I've hunkered down through quite a few hurricanes in my day, over a dozen, with a handful of them being a near direct hit from major storms.. I have friends in Florida (where I live) who take the same approach to hurricanes, as if being there on their property when it hits is going to make them able to prevent damage.. What can cause hurricane stationary near land? What kind of forces?. Earthquakes and fires out west, tornados and blizzards in the Midwest, hurricanes for the South and East, and blizzards and sometimes hurricanes in the northeast.. To be safe authorities issue state of emergencies and encourage people to evacuate any time there's even a chance of a major hurricane directly hitting the city, but most of the time the hurricane wea. I meant more storm effects. heavy rainfall might fall where inland. you be affected by the hurricane. A direct impact going caused. New Hanover issued a mandatory evac sometime very shortly. where does one find rainfall totals currently predicted?. your area caused those dangers. Force winds are expected closed. Physical access be impeded by debris , water , and winds ;. that can fall in a strong. the chaos is caused by too * late * warning. I got a feeling traffic gon. Min pressure: 962 mb (\u25bc 7 mb). most major (multi lane limited access highways) roads probably won't close, and debris is cleared quickly.. Expect significant impacts to ability to travel (bridges out from creek/river flooding, trees/power lines down) and loss of services like water and electricity. that be prepared for a change in the path. 120-130mph sustained wind speed. Dont underestimate the impact that this much rain could have in that area, which has already experienced landslides, flooding, and evacuations this year.
