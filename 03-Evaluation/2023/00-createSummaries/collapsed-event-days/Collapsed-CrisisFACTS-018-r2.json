Judi Hoffman to evacuate to a hotel.\n\nLying awake in the strange bed, thinking about the damage to her beautiful historic church, Hoffman recalled that just two Sundays ago the congregation held a \u201cCelebrate Recovery\u201d service for people recovering from addiction.\n\n In the early hours of March 3, multiple tornadoes touched down across Middle TN.

The tornadoes touched down Tuesday shortly after midnight, swirling through Nashville and its surrounding cities while taking down power lines and demolishing homes and other buildings.\n\n",
