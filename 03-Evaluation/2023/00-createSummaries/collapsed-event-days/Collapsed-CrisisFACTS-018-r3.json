The path of the tornado that hit Nashville and points east was 50 miles long. The NWS Nashville Tornado survey confirms the EF-3 tornado that struck Nashville, TN and many other communities was on the ground for 53.4 MILES and had a path width of 800 yards. The Nashville, TN tornado has been upgraded to an EF4 with an estimated updated path of ~83km (path still preliminary), causing 88 injuries and 18 deaths. The width of that monster tornado was nearly 1/2 mile at one point!",
