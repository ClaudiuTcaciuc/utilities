path -refill prescriptions (since the Governor has declared a State of Emergency, your pharmacist may be willing to give you a 30 day supply even if you have recently refilled, depending on the type

(http:\/\/www.floridahealth.gov\/programs-and-services\/emergency-preparedness-and-response\/disaster-response-resources\/spns-index.html) -If you use Home Health Care, inform them of your plans and request delivery of extra supplies (saline bags, alcohol wipes, etc) prior to the storm arriving -get cash out of ATM -fill car, generator and an extra red plastic gas can with gas -fill propane tanks
