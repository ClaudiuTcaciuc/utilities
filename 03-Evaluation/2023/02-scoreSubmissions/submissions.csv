We then score importance of our facts based on overlap with this summary of critical content and rank by this important score.,1111,abstractive,"This method uses a standard retrieval model to get a list of relevant sentences for each query. Then, for that query, we have a prompt that asks a transformer model to summarize the list of facts, ranked by their relevance to the query. This step produces a one-to-three-sentence summary for each query on each event-day pair. We then aggregate all the queries for a given event-day into a single document that we then ask GPT-3.5 to rewrite into a summary of the most critical content. We then the importance of facts for this event-day pair based on overlap with this summary.",1
